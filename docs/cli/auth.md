# Authentication

## Log in

In order to run any CLI command, you must authenticate first.

```bash
dvcs login
```

This will open a browser window or tab where you can log in to your account. Once you've logged in, the CLI will
automatically be notified and you should be good to go.

## Log out

```bash
dvcs logout
```

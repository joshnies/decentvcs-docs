# Introduction

Welcome to **DecentVCS, the simple and affordable version control system for large-file projects**.
We recommend checking out the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started/installation) section to create your first project
in less than 5 minutes. Or stick around to read more about how the platform works and all of the features it offers!
Either way, we're so glad you're here ðŸ¤—

## ðŸ—ƒ Decentralized storage

We utilize decentralized cloud storage to drastically reduce both storage and bandwidth costs across the board.
Along with E2E encryption and an always-available data infrastructure thanks to providers such as Storj and Filebase,
your data is securely stored and replicated across the globe to keep your project safe.

## ðŸ§µ Patch revisions

[Enable patch revisions](/docs/patch-revisions) on a per-project basis to further reduce storage costs by only uploading a patch file containing
the changes instead of the entire file every time (also known as a snapshot).

:::note

You also have the choice to use traditional atomic revisions, similar to other VCS solutions.

## ðŸ«£ Partial pulls

Pull only the changes you need to your local machine, making collaboration on larger projects faster so you can keep
on creating. This also helps reduce bandwidth usage to keep your costs even lower.

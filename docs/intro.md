# Introduction

Welcome to **DecentVCS, the simple version control system for massive projects.**

:::tip
Check out the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) section to create your first project in less than
5 minutes.

## Features

### üóÉ Decentralized storage

We utilize decentralized cloud storage to drastically reduce both storage and bandwidth costs across the board. This
results in saving up to 80% or more in costs compared to other solutions, all of which can go back into building your
dream.

Decentralizing your project's storage also provides numerous other benefits, including an always-available data
infrastructure with 100% uptime and unrivaled security so you can sleep soundly after a hard day's work.

### üßµ Patch revisions

Enable patch revisions on a per-project basis to further reduce storage costs by only uploading
a patch file containing the changes instead of the entire file every time (also known as a snapshot). This can also
drastically improve commit and workflow speed since there's less to upload to remote storage on every change. Time to
work smarter, not harder.

:::note

You also have the choice to use traditional atomic (snapshot-based) revisions used in other VCS solutions.

### ü´£ Partial pulls

Using local ignore files, you can pull only the changes you need to your local machine, making collaboration on larger
projects faster so you can keep on creating. This also helps reduce bandwidth usage to keep your costs even lower.

### üîê File locking with overrides

Lock files remotely to prevent changes by other team members while you work on them. Project administrators can also
**force-unlock** files at any time, allowing you to remain unblocked and to continue building.

### üñ• Cross-platform app

We built a [desktop app](https://decentvcs.com/downloads) for managing all of the complexities of VCS for
you.

### ü§ì CLI

Use the official [DecentVCS CLI](https://decentvcs.com/downloads) to manage your project from the terminal or integrate
DecentVCS into your custom workflow. Anything you can do with the desktop app, you can do with the CLI.

## What this means for you

Decentralizing your project's storage, utilizing a smart patch-based revision system, and numerous other upgrades
to the traditional large-file version control workflows of the past enable you and your team to work faster and smarter,
all while saving a ridiculous amount of money.

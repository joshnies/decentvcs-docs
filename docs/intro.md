## Features

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Fully-managed cloud hosting

We manage all of the cloud infrastructure for you, so you can focus on what matters most: building your project. No need
to deal with server maintenance, security, scaling, or storage providers.

### üóÉ Decentralized storage

We utilize decentralized cloud storage to drastically reduce both storage and bandwidth costs across the board, meaning
more money in your pocket to keep building your dream project. Other benefits include an always-available data
infrastructure with 100% uptime and unrivaled storage security.

### üßµ Patch revisions

Patch revisions further reduce storage costs by only uploading a patch file containing the changes instead of the entire
file every time (A.K.A. "atomic" or "snapshot" revisions). This can also drastically improve commit and workflow speed
since there's less to upload to remote storage on every change. It's time we work smarter, not harder.

:::note

Patch revsions are enabled on a per-project basis. You can still opt-in to traditional atomic revisions used in other
VCS solutions.

:::

### ü´£ Partial pulls

Using local ignore files, you can pull only the changes you need to your local machine, making collaboration on larger
projects faster so you can keep on creating. This also helps reduce bandwidth usage to keep your costs even lower.

### üîê File locking with overrides

Lock files remotely to prevent changes by other team members while you work on them. Project administrators can also
**force-unlock** files at any time, allowing your team to remain unblocked and prevent halts in development.

### üñ• Desktop app

:::caution

Coming soon.

:::

We built a [cross-platform desktop app](https://decentvcs.com/downloads) for managing all of the complexities of VCS for
you. Designed with creative teams in mind, we're making version control easy and accessible for everyone.

### ü§ì CLI

Use the official [DecentVCS CLI](https://decentvcs.com/downloads) to manage your project from the terminal or integrate
DecentVCS into your custom workflow. Anything you can do with the desktop app, you can do with the CLI.

## What this means for you

Decentralizing your project's storage, utilizing a smart patch-based revision system, and numerous other upgrades
to the traditional large-file version control workflows of the past enable you and your team to work faster and smarter,
all while saving a ridiculous amount of both time and money.

# Getting started

## Installing

DecentVCS can be used via the desktop app or the CLI. Both tools support all features.

**[Go to downloads page](https://decentvcs.com/download)**

:::tip

We recommend using the desktop app unless you need to integrate DecentVCS into your custom workflow.

## Creating a project

All of your files live in a **project**, and each team can have an unlimited amount of projects. Projects and all of
their files are **always private** to your team.

Let's create one!

## Creating a commit

Let's say you just made changes to your incredible new project. You can upload (or push) those changes as a new
**commit** in your project. This will create a new revision in your project that you can always go back to.

## Creating a branch

When working on a new feature or bug fix, it's always best practice to create a **branch**. This will allow you to
make changes to your project without affecting the rest of the project, stored in the root branch (which by default is
called `stable`). You can then **merge** your branch back into the root branch once you're done.

## Merging a branch

Time to merge that new branch!

## Final thoughts

That's it! You've just created your first project, committed some changes, created a branch, and merged it back into
the root branch. The real magic happens for you behind the scenes, as your files are stored in decentralized storage
for maximum security and reliability while drastically reducing your development costs.

We can't wait to see what your create! ðŸ¤—
